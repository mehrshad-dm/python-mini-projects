‍‍# 🧮 CLI Calculator with Error Handling (Python)

An improved version of a simple command-line calculator written in Python.  
This version adds **exception handling** to avoid crashes, especially in division operations.

## ✨ Features

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)  
  - Handles `ZeroDivisionError`
