# Nested Function Calculator ðŸ§®

This is a simple calculator project written in Python, created to practice **nested functions** and basic control flow.

It supports the following operations:
- Addition
- Multiplication
- Division (with zero division handling)
- Exponentiation (power)

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This project is built as a learning exercise to understand:
- How to use **functions inside functions (nested functions)** in Python
- Basic conditional logic (`if/elif/else`)
- Basic error handling using `try/except`

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The main function `calculate(a, b, what_to_do)` selects the appropriate operation based on the `what_to_do` string:

```python
result = calculate(4, 2, "exponentiation")
print(result)  # Output: 16
