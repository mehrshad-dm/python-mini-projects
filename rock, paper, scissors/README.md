# 🪨✋✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors - Terminal Game

A simple terminal-based **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game written in Python.  
You play against the computer. Each round, both you and the computer choose one of the three options:

- 🪨 **Rock** beats ✂️ Scissors  
- ✂️ **Scissors** beats 📄 Paper  
- 📄 **Paper** beats 🪨 Rock  
- If both players choose the same, it's a draw.

This project is great for Python beginners and those learning about conditionals, loops, and user input.
